    "**Matrix $A$ is invertible (nonsingular) if A is square matrix and consists of linearly independent collumns. (A matrix is called singular if it consists of linearly dependent collumns).**\n",
    "\n",
    " **Proof 1:** We can think that when $A (mxn)$ is invertible then the linear equation $Ax =b$ does have only solution $x =A^{-1}b$. To achieve this, we can think of the span of column vectors of A in collumn space. Since $Ax = a_{:,1}x_1 + a_{:,2}x_2 + a_{:,n} x_n $, where $a_{:,i}$ is $i^{th}$ column of matrix $A$, $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ element of vector $x$, $Ax$ is the linear combination of all collums of $A$ and $x$ is coefficents. There is two requirements:\n",
    " \n",
    "  a) Columns of A must span the space $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$ meaning that every points $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$, can be described as a linear combination with some coefficients $x$ of columns of $A$. Thus, all collums of $A$ must be linearly independent and the number of columns $n$ of $A$ must be equal or more than number of rows $m$ ( $n \\geq m$ ).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  b) Since there is only one solution $x$, $A$ must be square matrix ($m = n$), else more than one solution exists because there exists more than one set of linearly independent in $A$. This could be also be explain that if A is not square matrix $AB \\neq BA$, this contradicts the definition of the inverse of matrix$.\n",

    "When solving linear equation $Ax = b$, we can think of $AX$, where is a matrix $m \\times n$, and $X$is a vector $n x 1$ as a row picture or collumn picture. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Ax = $\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$ $\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$ =  $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",

    "\n",
    "In **collum picture** $b$ is  a linear combination of columns of A. We can write:\n",
    "$ Ax = x\\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix} + y \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} =\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}$, \n",
    "where each column of A if a vector in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Based on this intuition, if columns of A are linearly independent, then all combinations of them covers entire $ \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ space. It means that there always exists a soluton $X$ so that the linear combination $AX =b$\n",

    "\n",
    "Gauss or Gauss-Jordan algorithm can be used to solve $AX =b $ using eliminations. By applying three followings elementary operations, one can transform any matrix to row-echelon form (Gauss) and reduced row-echelon form (Gauss-Jordan):\n",
    "- Interchange two rows \n",
    "- Multiply a row by a nonzero constant\n",
    "- Add a multiple of a row to another row\n",

    "\n",
    "$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 8 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 1  \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -2\\\\ 0 & 4 & 1   \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -2\\\\ 0 & 0 & 5  \\end{bmatrix}$ (Row-echelon form).\n",
    "Now, using back-subtitution, we can solve for $X$\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, all above elemetary row operations can be done using matrix multiplication between A and elemetary matrices. Simmilar as the way we think $AX$ is a linear combination of columns, we can think $XA$ is the linear combination of rows, where X is a row vector $1xm$, and the results of $XA$ is another row vector. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "$AX = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = 1* \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} + 2*\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} + 0*\\begin{bmatrix}  3 & 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}  = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the above idea, to convert $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 3 & 8 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 4 & 1  \\end{bmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -2\\\\ 0 & 4 & 1   \\end{bmatrix} $, we basically keep row 1 and row 3 while subtract row 2 from 3 times of row 1. Thus, the elementary matrix $E_{21}$ to do this is: \n",

    "Above elementary matrices can be combined into a unique one: $ E = E_{32}E_{21} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In some other cases, sometimes we want to switch two rows. Let's say we want to switch row 1 and row 2 of A. The elementary matrix (permutation matrix) to achieve this is: \n",

    "\n",
    "To find the inverse of matrix A, we can convert the joint matrix $[A, I]$ into $[I, R]$ using Gauss-Jordan method, then  $R =A^{-1}$. This is because when we transform $A$ into indentity matrix $I$, we use elementary matrix $E$: $EA = I$, thus E is $A^{-1}$. Additionally, we also multitply $E$ with $I$ to get $R=EI=E$, thus $R$ is exactly $E$ matrix.\n",

    " - A is not square matrix \n",

    "Assume there's no row exchanges when peforming elemination, the matrix $L = E_{21}^{-1}E_{32}^{-1}$ is lower triangluar matrix.$ THis is because all elemetary matrices not for row exchanges are lower triangluar matrix, thus their inveserse and their multiplcations also have lower triangular form. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1\\\\ 8 & 7 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 4 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 2& 1\\\\ 0 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
