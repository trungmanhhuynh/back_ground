    "**Matrix $A$ is invertible (nonsingular) if A is square matrix and consists of linearly independent collumns. (A matrix is called singular if it consists of linearly dependent collumns).**\n",
    "\n",
    " **Proof 1:** We can think that when $A (mxn)$ is invertible then the linear equation $Ax =b$ does have only solution $x =A^{-1}b$. To achieve this, we can think of the span of column vectors of A in collumn space. Since $Ax = a_{:,1}x_1 + a_{:,2}x_2 + a_{:,n} x_n $, where $a_{:,i}$ is $i^{th}$ column of matrix $A$, $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ element of vector $x$, $Ax$ is the linear combination of all collums of $A$ and $x$ is coefficents. There is two requirements:\n",
    " \n",
    "  a) Columns of A must span the space $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$ meaning that every points $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$, can be described as a linear combination with some coefficients $x$ of columns of $A$. Thus, all collums of $A$ must be linearly independent and the number of columns $n$ of $A$ must be equal or more than number of rows $m$ ( $n \\geq m$ ).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  b) Since there is only one solution $x$, $A$ must be square matrix ($m = n$), else more than one solution exists because there exists more than one set of linearly independent in $A$. This could be also be explain that if A is not square matrix $AB \\neq BA$, this contradicts the definition of the inverse of matrix$.\n",
